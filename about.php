      <h4>Healthy Smiles Medical Appointment System</h4>
      <p> Healthcare is changing with a new emphasis on patient-centeredness. Fundamental to this transformation is the increasing recognition       of patients' role in health care delivery and design. Medical appointment scheduling, as the starting point of most non-urgent health       care services, is undergoing major developments to support active involvement of patients. By using the Internet as a medium, patients     are given more freedom in decision making about their preferences for the appointments and have improved access. </p>
        
        
      <p> Cancer is one of the commonest causes of patient death in the clinic and a complex disease occurring in multiple organs per system,         multiple systems per organ, or both, in the body. The poor diagnoses, therapies and prognoses of the disease could be mainly due to the     variation of severities, durations, locations, sensitivity and resistance against drugs, cell differentiation and origin, and               understanding of pathogenesis. (Chang Gung Med J. 2005 Apr;28(4):201-11.) </p>
        
        
      <p>Basically, our proposed system will help you book an appointment easily and you will get to see a specialist who is highly skilled and      can give you the necessary and required assistance with your cancer condition. </p>
